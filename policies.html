    <p id ="polks">The Kyper for President Campaign looks to bring strength and unity back to the United States.<br><br>
-We want to include all perspectives in the deal making process in order to do what is best for the American people.<br>
-We want to base our principles on compromise, because one set mind-set and ideology creates division, not unity in the law<br><br>
-We look to bring strength and stability to the Middle Class of America by:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Making the rich pay their fair share of taxes<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Since the 2008 recession, the top one percent has seen the most economic growth<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Close tax loopholes and simplify the extensiveness of deductions and write-offs, 			so the top one percent and the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corporations of America re-invest in the middle 			class<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Lowering taxes on the middle class, relieving economic pressure. The more money that 	the middle class is able to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spend, the more money can be spent for circulation in the 	economy, creating an economic stimulation that benefits &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every single American<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Bringing jobs back to the work force of America
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	-The government has been creating jobs, but desk and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office jobs. We need to 			create working jobs that re-invest in America.<br><br>
-Infrastructure:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	-We want to rebuild the infrastructure of the United States<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	-The reconstruction of railways and motorways creates tremendous amounts of 			jobs that stimulate the economy, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and solidify transportation in the country.<br><br>
-Government Programs:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-We look to use the excess revenue gained from closing tax loopholes to replenish 	the dwindling Medicare and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Security programs, so that you can have security in 	your future.<br><br>
Overall, our policies reflect our main goal to support the burdened middle class, and the Kyper for President Campaign fully believes we can do just that.
